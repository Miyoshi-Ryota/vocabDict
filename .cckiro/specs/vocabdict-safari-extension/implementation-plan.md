# VocabDict Safari Web Extension - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan outlines the step-by-step approach to building the VocabDict Safari Web Extension within a 1-week timeline. The plan follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles using the Detroit School approach.

## Development Timeline

**Total Duration**: 7 days  
**Daily Commitment**: 4-6 hours  
**Methodology**: TDD (Detroit School), iterative development

## Git Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- **main**: Stable, working code only
- **Feature branches**: One branch per implementation section
  - `feature/project-setup` (Day 1)
  - `feature/dictionary-service` (Day 2)
  - `feature/background-worker` (Day 3)
  - `feature/popup-ui-base` (Day 4)
  - `feature/learning-mode` (Day 5)
  - `feature/content-script` (Day 6)
  - `feature/polish-deployment` (Day 7)

### Commit Guidelines
- **Commit frequently**: After each passing test or completed subtask
- **Commit message format**: `type: description`
  - `feat:` new feature
  - `fix:` bug fix
  - `test:` adding tests
  - `refactor:` code refactoring
  - `docs:` documentation changes
  - `style:` formatting, missing semicolons, etc.
- **Examples**:
  - `test: add StorageManager CRUD tests`
  - `feat: implement dictionary lookup with fuzzy matching`
  - `fix: handle storage quota exceeded error`

### Workflow Process
1. Create feature branch from main
2. Make small, atomic commits
3. Push branch regularly
4. Merge to main when feature is complete and tested
5. Delete feature branch after merge

### Documentation Updates
- Update spec documents directly in their original locations
- Never create temporary copies
- Commit documentation changes with code changes

## General Feedback Tracking

Throughout development, general feedback and insights will be documented in:
- `.claude/development-notes.md` - For patterns and best practices discovered
- `.claude/feedback-log.md` - For user feedback that applies broadly

## Implementation Guidelines

### TDD Approach (Detroit School)
1. Write failing test first
2. Implement minimal code to pass test
3. Refactor while keeping tests green
4. Use real objects instead of mocks where possible
5. Only mock browser APIs and external dependencies

### Code Organization

Building on the existing Xcode Safari Extension App structure:

```

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all business logic
- Integration tests for component communication
- Manual testing on Safari (macOS and iOS)
- Minimum 80% code coverage

### Key Development Principles
1. **Incremental Development**: Complete one feature fully before moving to next
2. **Continuous Testing**: Run tests after every change
3. **Early Integration**: Test on actual Safari frequently
4. **User-Centric**: Test actual user workflows regularly
5. **Performance First**: Profile and optimize as you go

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Challenges and Solutions

1. **Safari API Limitations**
   - Solution: Test early, have fallbacks ready
   - Keep Safari documentation handy

2. **iOS-specific Issues**
   - Solution: Test on real iOS device daily
   - Have iOS simulator ready

3. **Time Constraints**
   - Solution: Focus on MVP features first
   - Cut scope if needed (e.g., reduce toy dictionary size)

4. **Storage Limitations**
   - Solution: Implement data cleanup early
   - Test with maximum data loads

## Lessons Learned

### Day 1 Insights
1. **Safari Extension Specifics**:
   - Use `service_worker` instead of `scripts` in manifest v3
   - No ES6 module support in Safari extensions
   - Xcode project file needs all resources explicitly listed

2. **Build Configuration**:
   - Webpack should output directly to Resources folder
   - Don't use CleanWebpackPlugin - it removes essential files
   - Build JS files first, then build in Xcode

3. **Testing**:
   - Detroit School TDD works well for extension development
   - Mock only browser APIs, use real objects elsewhere
   - 19 tests written and passing on Day 1

### Day 2 Insights
1. **Architecture Decisions**:
   - Dictionary is single source of truth for word definitions
   - VocabularyList only manages user-specific data
   - Services vs Models: Services manage state/operations, Models would be data structures

2. **Implementation Details**:
   - VocabularyList placed in services (not models) as it manages data
   - Removed lookupCount from VocabularyList (belongs to dictionary if needed)
   - 61 tests passing (dictionary + vocabulary list)

### Day 3 Insights
1. **Message Handler Architecture**:
   - Centralized message handling in background service worker
   - All services passed as dependencies for easy testing
   - Async message handling with proper error propagation

2. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Real integration tests are more valuable than mock tests
   - Test complete workflows, not just individual functions
   - In-memory storage implementation for testing (not mocks)

3. **Service Organization**:
   - SpacedRepetition as a service (not model) - contains business logic
   - Clear separation between message handling and business logic
   - 26 new tests added (20 unit + 6 integration)

### Day 4 Insights
1. **Popup UI Architecture**:
   - Complete 4-tab navigation system (Search, Lists, Learn, Settings)
   - Professional CSS design system with CSS variables
   - Theme switching with system preference detection
   - Toast notification system for user feedback (added beyond plan)

2. **Testing Approach Evolution**:
   - Updated browser mock to use real message handler
   - Created waitFor helpers for reliable async testing
   - Added window.matchMedia polyfill for theme testing
   - 35 new tests added (25 unit + 10 integration)

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - Debounced search with 300ms delay
   - Recent searches persistence
   - ARIA attributes for accessibility
   - Responsive design for various screen sizes
   - Settings tab implemented early (was planned for Day 6)

4. **Scope Adjustments**:
   - Learning tab created but not implemented (just placeholder)
   - Advanced list features (sorting/filtering) deferred to Day 5
   - Added toast notifications for better UX (not in original plan)
   - Settings tab brought forward from Day 6

5. **Safari Extension Challenges Resolved**:
   - **Popup not displaying**: Fixed CSP blocking inline scripts and Safari CSS body dimension issues
   - **New list creation**: Replaced browser prompt() with custom dialog (Safari blocks prompt in extensions)
   - **Theme detection**: Removed auto system theme detection due to unreliable Safari extension API support
   - **Testing strategy**: Updated all tests to match new implementation patterns

### Day 5 Insights
1. **TDD Implementation Success**:
   - Followed Detroit School TDD religiously: wrote 23 SpacedRepetition tests first
   - All Learning Mode functionality test-driven from start
   - 8 comprehensive integration tests for complete user flows
   - Real dictionary words used instead of mock data for more realistic testing

2. **Learning Mode Architecture**:
   - Complete flashcard system with 3D CSS transforms
   - Horizontal 4-button layout (Know/Learning/Skip/Mastered) optimized for limited space
   - Minimal progress display (2/5 format) replacing bulky progress bars
   - Session completion with detailed statistics and navigation options

3. **UI/UX Optimization Achievements**:
   - Eliminated all scrolling requirements in 600x700px viewport
   - Perfected vertical spacing balance (16px/8px consistent margins)
   - Flashcard height optimization (320px-350px) for maximum content visibility
   - Search screen layout fixes: empty space removal and proper content scrolling

4. **Performance and Accessibility**:
   - Keyboard shortcuts (Space/Enter to flip, 1-4 for actions)
   - ARIA labels and proper semantic HTML throughout
   - Responsive typography using CSS clamp() functions
   - Smooth animations with reduced motion support

5. **Technical Achievements**:
   - SpacedRepetition algorithm with proper interval calculations
   - Review queue management with due date filtering
   - Message passing architecture for review processing
   - Comprehensive error handling and edge case coverage
