- Toy dictionary with 5 words implemented (reduced from planned 50)
- Full dictionary lookup functionality working
- Context menu and floating widget implemented

### 🔄 Phase 3: Vocabulary Management (IN PROGRESS)
- Basic word addition to lists working
- List persistence implemented
- UI for list management pending

### ⏳ Phase 4: Learning Mode (NOT STARTED)
### ⏳ Phase 5: Polish and Optimization (NOT STARTED)

---

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (COMPLETED)

### 1.1 Extension Manifest ✅
**Files modified:**
- `Shared (Extension)/Resources/manifest.json`

**Completed Tasks:**
- ✅ Updated permissions for storage, contextMenus, activeTab, tabs
- ✅ Configured content scripts for all URLs
- ✅ Set up icons and extension metadata
- ✅ Configured background script as service worker

**Deviations from Plan:**
- Changed from persistent background page to service worker for Safari compatibility

### 1.2 Storage Layer ✅
**Implementation Approach:**
- Instead of separate files, integrated into `background.js` as classes

**Completed Features:**
- ✅ IndexedDB wrapper class (`VocabDictDatabase`)
- ✅ CRUD operations for all data models
- ✅ Data model classes:
  - `VocabularyWord` (simplified - removed `listIds` in refactoring)
  - `VocabularyList`
  - `UserSettings`
  - `LearningStats`
- ✅ Error handling and validation
- ✅ Automatic database initialization

**Key Technical Decisions:**
- Used IndexedDB directly instead of browser.storage API for better performance
- Removed bidirectional relationship between words and lists (only lists track wordIds)

### 1.3 Message Passing System ✅
**Implementation:**
- Consolidated into `background.js`

**Completed Features:**
- ✅ Message types defined as constants (`MessageTypes`)
- ✅ Centralized message router with handler registration
- ✅ Request/response pattern with success/error states
- ✅ Comprehensive message validation
- ✅ 21 different message handlers implemented

**Message Types Implemented:**
- Dictionary operations (lookup, cache)
- Word CRUD operations
- List CRUD operations
- Settings management
- Stats tracking
- UI operations (notifications, popup control)
- Content script operations

### 1.4 Base UI Components ✅
**Files created:**
- `popup.css` - Comprehensive styling
- `content.css` - Content script styles

**Completed Features:**
- ✅ Modern, clean design system
- ✅ Theme switching (light/dark/auto)
- ✅ Reusable CSS classes
- ✅ Loading states and transitions
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Tab-based navigation

## Phase 2: Dictionary Features (COMPLETED)

### 2.1 Toy Dictionary Data ✅
**Implementation:**
- Integrated into `background.js` as `TOY_DICTIONARY`
- Separate `dictionary.js` file for extended dictionary

**Completed Features:**
- ✅ 5 complete word entries (hello, world, good, time, work)
- ✅ Full dictionary data structure with:
  - Pronunciations (US/UK)
  - Multiple definitions with examples
  - Synonyms and antonyms
  - Part of speech information
- ✅ Dictionary lookup service
- ✅ Caching mechanism via IndexedDB

**Deviations:**
- Reduced from 50 to 5 words for initial implementation
- No fuzzy search implemented yet

### 2.2 Content Script ✅
**Files created/modified:**
- `content.js` - Complete implementation
- `content.css` - Floating widget styles

**Completed Features:**
- ✅ Text selection monitoring
- ✅ Floating widget with mini dictionary view
- ✅ Smart positioning (prevents off-screen)
- ✅ Click-outside dismissal
- ✅ Add to list functionality from widget
- ✅ "More" button to open full popup

**Issues Fixed During Testing:**
- Widget null reference errors
- Event propagation issues
- Widget persistence during async operations

### 2.3 Context Menu Integration ✅
**Completed Features:**
- ✅ "Look up '[word]' in VocabDict" context menu
- ✅ Context menu click handling
- ✅ Integration with floating widget
- ✅ Fallback to popup if content script not loaded

**Known Issues:**
- Keyboard shortcuts not yet implemented
- Duplicate context menu items occasionally appear

### 2.4 Dictionary View in Popup ✅
**Completed Features:**
- ✅ Search input with real-time lookup
- ✅ Comprehensive word display:
  - Pronunciations
  - Multiple definitions
  - Synonyms/antonyms as clickable tags
  - Examples
- ✅ "Add to List" button with visual feedback
- ✅ Clean, modern UI design
- ✅ Loading and error states

## Phase 3: Vocabulary Management (PARTIAL)

### 3.1 List Management Backend ✅
**Completed:**
- ✅ Database operations for lists
- ✅ Default list creation
- ✅ List CRUD operations in background script

**Pending:**
- ❌ UI for list management
- ❌ Visual list display in popup

### 3.2 Word Management Backend ✅
**Completed:**
- ✅ Add words to lists functionality
- ✅ Track lookup count
- ✅ Prevent duplicates
- ✅ Word-list association (one-way)

**Pending:**
- ❌ UI to view words in lists
- ❌ Word editing interface
- ❌ Sorting and filtering UI

### 3.3 Auto-add Features ⚠️
**Completed:**
- ✅ Settings structure for auto-add
- ⚠️ Manual add working, auto-add setting exists but not fully integrated

### 3.4 Import/Export ❌
**Not started**

## Implementation Deviations and Technical Decisions

### Architecture Changes
1. **Single-file approach**: Due to Safari extension limitations, consolidated most logic into `background.js` rather than modular files
2. **Service worker**: Changed from persistent background page to service worker
3. **Simplified data model**: Removed bidirectional word-list relationship

### Database Design Changes
1. **Word model simplified**: Removed `listIds` from words, only lists track their words
2. **Direct IndexedDB**: Used IndexedDB directly instead of browser.storage wrapper

### UI/UX Improvements
1. **Floating widget**: Added for better in-context lookup experience
2. **Theme system**: Implemented comprehensive theme switching
3. **Visual feedback**: Added success states for user actions

### Known Issues to Address

1. **Critical Issues:**
   - Settings persistence not working properly
   - My Lists tab shows only placeholder
   - Message passing fails in webpage console context

2. **Important Issues:**
   - No visual way to see vocabulary lists
   - Missing keyboard shortcuts
   - No error recovery for database failures

3. **Minor Issues:**
   - Debug code needs cleanup
   - Code organization could be improved
   - Missing code comments
